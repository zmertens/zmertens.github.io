 - [Checkers](https://github.com/zmertens/Checkers)

This started as a school project for an *Introduction to Programming Languages, CSE240* course at **Arizona State University**.
The idea was to create the Checkers logic in C++, and for extra credit, add a GUI. I don't remember if we got to adding the GUI, but afterwords I kept working on it and used [SFML](sfml-dev.org) to create some graphics. It helped me land an internship later on which was great.
