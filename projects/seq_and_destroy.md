 - [SeqNDestroy](https://github.com/zmertens/SeqAndDestroy)

I worked on this in the [Cartwright Lab](https://cartwrig.ht/) for a community outreach event with @anderspitman and @aahowell3. The idea was to make a bubble-shooter-like game that emulates how HIV cells are reproduced and destroyed.
Most of the JavaScript was written by @anderspitman; we used PhaserIO for the game engine and I shamelessly took one of the PhaserIO Worley shader examples to use as a background.
