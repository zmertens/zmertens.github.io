I attempted to make a first-person shooter from scratch. 
Inspiration came from [this's guys Wolfenstein clone](https://github.com/BennyQBD/Wolfenstein3DClone).
I also added some Phong shading and Perlin noise and some sounds and music. I never really could get past that point once I had those features working. I thought of trying to add A-star pathfinding and automated level generation but I couldn't really keep up with the complexity of the code.

Overall, *MazeGameCpp* was a good learning experience and I think it gave me an estimate of about how much of my own code I could manage in a one-man-wolf-project.

I've since moved on to trying to use bonafide game engines such as [BabylonJS](https://doc.babylonjs.com/) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and I dabbled with Unity and Unreal for a bit.

Other thoughts about game engines and the creative process can be expertly summarized in [this senior developer's lecture](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwidhKub-6HbAhVDR6wKHfHBBnIQtwIITjAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGK7ntA7a2vk&usg=AOvVaw1rtrkCC_u7X4_ER08MOh4o) at Digipen.
