# Burnout
 - triangulation, verbatim
 - talking, patronizing, faces heading
 - Broken glasses, distoreted views
 - Hollow spaces, hauntingg &self
 - Hunting memories
 - Recursing aliterally metaphorically
 - Complexity is easy
 - Confused by the masses
 - Perplexed by the speech
 - Elders unapproachable
 - Listeners that don't want to watch
 - The forest of life burn
 - Suffucating wheels spinning
 - Collapsing sun, Jupiter's vision
 - Mother's wisdom, warnings
 - Smoke scattering, wheels blurring
 - Engines revving, whistles turning
 - Knees dragging
 - unioninzing generators
 - Burning and fleeing
 - From the forgotten paradise
 - Of oil drenched cement gasoline
 - So what if I made a big mistake?
 - Machine nation
 - Shifting sideways, fishboning
 - The tail of the whale fleeing
 - And the smoke fading
 - Let the burnout finish and reveal
 - Those who will be wasted
 - Those who will be burned
