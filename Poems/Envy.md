# Envy the Flame

Treants set on Fire
Racing like loops until harvest
Harvest the Envy
Earthen Throne
Everybody's home
Reminder of integrity
Stolen idolatry
Treants from the Forest for the Trees
Burning the leaves
The leaves that fall, like seasons, like relationships
Running through fire, the transformation
Timeline that stretches, proving desperation
Treants like our friends
Forest keepers, guarding the Den
But I can't keep me from self-destroying
Ignoring the warnings, blazing, ashes
Coveting the Throne, stolen Home
Now I wander alone, looking for calm
Remedy from the flame
To seek a home again, to emblazen my name
