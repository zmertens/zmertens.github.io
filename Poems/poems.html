<h1>Envy</h1>
<p>Treants set on Fire<br>
Racing like loops until harvest<br>
Harvest the Envy<br>
Earthen Throne<br>
Everybody's home<br>
Reminder of integrity<br>
Stolen idolatry<br>
Treants from the Forest for the Trees<br>
Burning the leaves<br>
The leaves that fall, like seasons, like relationships<br>
Running through fire, the transformation<br>
Timeline that stretches, proving desperation<br>
Treants like our friends<br>
Forest keepers, guarding the Den<br>
Chaotic destruction<br>
Ignoring the warnings, blazing, ashes<br>
Coveting the Throne, stolen Home<br>
Now I wander alone, looking for calm<br>
Remedy from the flame<br>
To seek a home again, to emblazen my name</p>
<h1>Burnout</h1>
<p>Randomized Nouns<br>
Triangulation, verbatim<br>
Buying, selling, trading, bowing, heading<br>
Broken glasses, distorted views<br>
Immeasurable faces, haunting &amp;self<br>
Hunting for memories<br>
Aliteral translation<br>
Complexity is easy<br>
Confused by the mass<br>
Perplexed by the speech<br>
Elders imcomprehensible<br>
Listeners that can't be watchers<br>
Forests of azure<br>
Suffucating wheels spinning<br>
Collapsing sun, Jupiter's horizon<br>
Mother Nature's wisdom<br>
Smoke scattering, wheels blurring<br>
Engines revving, whistles turning<br>
Knees dragging, elbows flailing<br>
Rapidly unioninzing engines ; Machine Nation<br>
Burning and fleeing free from the clutch<br>
Paradise forgotten<br>
Oil drenched cement gasoline<br>
So what if I made a big mistake?<br>
Shifting lateralusly and fishboning<br>
The Burnout filters the remainders<br>
All those who will be wasted</p>
