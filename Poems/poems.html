<h1>Ember</h1>
<p>Treants set on Fire<br>
Racing from the harvest<br>
Harvest the embers<br>
On an Earthen Throne<br>
Nomad's home<br>
Remember Incendiary<br>
Stolen idolatry<br>
Treants from the Forest for the Trees<br>
Burning the leaves<br>
The leaves that fall, like seasons, like relationships<br>
Running through fire, through transformation<br>
Through the fire through the flame<br>
Timeline that stretches, predict desperation<br>
Treants like our friends<br>
Forest keepers, guarding the Den<br>
Chaotic destruction<br>
Playing and getting burned, blazing, ashes<br>
Coveting the Throne, stolen Home<br>
Wandering and looking for calm<br>
Remedy from the flame<br>
To seek a home again, to emblazen my name</p>
<h1>Burnout</h1>
<p>Randomized Faces<br>
Braking verbatim<br>
monotonous wheel turning<br>
proud mary keep on burning<br>
Hunting for memories<br>
Aliteral translation<br>
Complexity is easy<br>
Forests of azure<br>
rolling down the US60<br>
Collapsing sun, Jupiter's horizon<br>
Mother Nature's wisdom<br>
Smoke scattering like quasars<br>
Engines revving, whistles turning<br>
Knees dragging, elbows flailing<br>
Rapidly unioninzing engines ; Machine Nation<br>
Burning and fleeing free from the clutch<br>
Paradise forgotten<br>
Oil drenched cement gasoline<br>
So what if I made a big mistake?<br>
Shifting laterally and fishboning<br>
Paradise wasted</p>
