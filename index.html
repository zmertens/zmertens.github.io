    <p>I attempted to make a first-person shooter from scratch.
    Inspiration came from <a href="https://github.com/BennyQBD/Wolfenstein3DClone">this's guys Wolfenstein clone</a>.
    I also added some Phong shading and Perlin noise and some sounds and music. I never really could get past that point once I had those features working. I thought of trying to add A-star pathfinding and automated level generation but I couldn't really keep up with the complexity of the code.</p>
    <p>Overall, <em>MazeGameCpp</em> was a good learning experience and I think it gave me an estimate of about how much of my own code I could manage in a one-man-wolf-project.</p>
    <p>I've since moved on to trying to use bonafide game engines such as <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/">BabylonJS</a> and <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> and I dabbled with Unity and Unreal for a bit.</p>
    <p>Other thoughts about game engines and the creative process can be expertly summarized in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=video&amp;cd=9&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidhKub-6HbAhVDR6wKHfHBBnIQtwIITjAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGK7ntA7a2vk&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rtrkCC_u7X4_ER08MOh4o">this senior developer's lecture</a> at Digipen.</p>

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zmertens/Checkers">Checkers</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This started as a school project for an <em>Introduction to Programming Languages, CSE240</em> course at <strong>Arizona State University</strong>.
    The idea was to create the Checkers logic in C++, and for extra credit, add a GUI. I don't remember if we got to adding the GUI, but afterwords I kept working on it and used <a href="sfml-dev.org">SFML</a> to create some graphics. It helped me land an internship later on which was great.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zmertens/SeqAndDestroy">SeqNDestroy</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>I worked on this in the <a href="https://cartwrig.ht/">Cartwright Lab</a> for a community outreach event with @anderspitman and @aahowell3. The idea was to make a bubble-shooter-like game that emulates how HIV cells are reproduced and destroyed.
    Most of the JavaScript was written by @anderspitman; we used PhaserIO for the game engine and I shamelessly took one of the PhaserIO Worley shader examples to use as a background.</p>

    <p>This is a toy application that lets you render small blocks of 3D text and save it as a PNG or GIF.
    It's a work-in-progress and written using <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/">BabylonJS</a>.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zmertens/cmake-example">cmake-example</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is how I remind me how to use CMake.
    Some of the features include ExternalDependencies and creating a shared/static library.
    I've been down the bottle of every build system, <em>yeah</em>.</p>
