 - [MazeGameCpp](https://github.com/zmertens/MazeGameCpp)

I attempted to make a first-person shooter from scratch. 
Inspiration came from [this's guys Wolfenstein clone](https://github.com/BennyQBD/Wolfenstein3DClone).
I also added some Phong shading and Perlin noise and some sounds and music. I never really could get past that point once I had those features working. I thought of trying to add A-star pathfinding and automated level generation but I couldn't really keep up with the complexity of the code.

Overall, *MazeGameCpp* was a good learning experience and I think it gave me an estimate of about how much of my own code I could manage in a one-man-wolf-project.

I've since moved on to trying to use bonafide game engines such as [BabylonJS](https://doc.babylonjs.com/) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and I dabbled with Unity and Unreal for a bit.

Other thoughts about game engines and the creative process can be expertly summarized in [this senior developer's lecture](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwidhKub-6HbAhVDR6wKHfHBBnIQtwIITjAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGK7ntA7a2vk&usg=AOvVaw1rtrkCC_u7X4_ER08MOh4o) at Digipen.

 - [Checkers](https://github.com/zmertens/Checkers)

This started as a school project for an *Introduction to Programming Languages, CSE240* course at **Arizona State University**.
The idea was to create the Checkers logic in C++, and for extra credit, add a GUI. I don't remember if we got to adding the GUI, but afterwords I kept working on it and used [SFML](sfml-dev.org) to create some graphics. It helped me land an internship later on which was great.

 - [SeqNDestroy](https://github.com/zmertens/SeqAndDestroy)

I worked on this in the [Cartwright Lab](https://cartwrig.ht/) for a community outreach event with @anderspitman and @aahowell3. The idea was to make a bubble-shooter-like game that emulates how HIV cells are reproduced and destroyed.
Most of the JavaScript was written by @anderspitman; we used PhaserIO for the game engine and I shamelessly took one of the PhaserIO Worley shader examples to use as a background.

 - [InitializeMyInitials](https://github.com/zmertens/InitializeMyInitials)

This is a toy application that lets you render small blocks of 3D text and save it as a PNG or GIF. 
It's a work-in-progress and written using [BabylonJS](https://doc.babylonjs.com/).

 - [cmake-example](https://github.com/zmertens/cmake-example)

This is how I remind me how to use CMake. 
Some of the features include ExternalDependencies and creating a shared/static library.
I've been down the bottle of every build system, *yeah*.
